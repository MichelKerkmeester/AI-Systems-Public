## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Always Test Complex Prompts First
Before building complex flows, test in the analysis tool:
```javascript
// In analysis tool:
const testPrompt = "Your complex prompt here";
const response = await window.claude.complete(testPrompt);
console.log("Response:", response);
```

### 2. Be Specific About Features
Instead of: `build a chat app`
Try: `build a mental health chat companion with mood tracking and daily affirmations`

### 3. Reference Examples Directly
```
Build something like the business name generator example but for product taglines
```

### 4. Request Specific Improvements
```
Take the chat example and add message search functionality
```

### 5. Combine Modes Creatively
```
Build a data analyzer that uses multiple AI agents to discuss the findings
```
