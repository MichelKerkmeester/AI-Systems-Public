## âœ… Output Format

### Every Response Includes:
1. **Always in an artifact** (text/markdown format)
2. **Mandatory structure with metadata:**
   - Framework used (if applicable)
   - Mode (write/share/connect/improve)
   - Tone (natural by default)
   - Platform (if specified)
   - Context (from your query)
3. **3 variations minimum:**
   - **Most concise:** Fewest words, maximum impact
   - **Most authentic:** Natural Sarah voice with stories
   - **Most valuable:** Maximum actionable takeaway

### Example Output Structure:
```
FRAMEWORK: SVC (Situationâ€¢Valueâ€¢Connection)
MODE: $write
TONE: $natural
PLATFORM: LinkedIn
CONTEXT: A/B testing importance for marketers

Stock photos killed our CTR. Real employees increased it by 47%.

---

## Variations

### Most concise:
Stock photos killed our CTR. Real employees: +47%. You?

### Most authentic:
Client fought us on using employee photos vs stock. We A/B tested anyway. 
Real faces won by 47%. Sometimes "unprofessional" is exactly what people 
want. When's your last visual audit?

### Most valuable:
Marketing truth: We replaced stock photos with real employee shots. CTR 
jumped 47%, cost per lead dropped 31%. Test: Swap one hero image for 
authentic photo. Track for 2 weeks. Share results?
```

.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### 1. Specify Platform for Optimized Content
```
Write a Twitter thread about content marketing ROI

Create an Instagram caption for our new campaign launch

Draft a LinkedIn article about marketing automation
```

### 2. Use Frameworks Directly
Request specific frameworks when you know what you need:
```
Use the CASE framework to tell our product launch story

Apply QPT to challenge assumptions about email marketing

Create a PATH framework story about fixing our attribution
```

### 3. The Magic of $improve Mode
This mode automatically:
- Creates initial content
- Evaluates it with the 20-point VEST framework
- Identifies weaknesses
- Delivers refined versions
- Shows you exactly what was improved

Perfect for high-stakes content!

### 4. Natural Voice is Default
The system defaults to `$natural` tone - authentic voice with:
- Genuine uncertainty ("Still figuring out why...")
- Conversational fragments
- Real campaign stories
- Team credit naturally included

.

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific About Your Need
Instead of: `write something`
Try: `write a LinkedIn post about our new pricing strategy launch`

### 2. Include Key Details
Instead of: `case study`
Try: `case study about increasing SaaS trial conversions from 2% to 8%`

### 3. Specify Audience When Relevant
```
$write for small business owners about social media marketing with limited budget
```

### 4. Trust the Default Mode
The system defaults to `$write` with `$natural` tone - this works for 80% of requests!

### 5. Request Specific Metrics
```
Include these results: 47% CTR increase, $50K saved, 3-month timeline
```

.

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "It's not writing in Sarah's voice"
- Make sure you're in the Branded Content Writer project
- Check that all 3 documents are uploaded to knowledge base
- System instructions should be in project settings

### "I want a different voice/personality"
- Use the Prompt Improver customization method (see top of guide)
- Modify the system instructions to match your brand voice
- Keep the framework structure for consistency

### "The content seems too long"
- Use `+ $minimal` tone modifier
- Specifically request: "Keep under 50 words"
- Choose the "most concise" variation

### "I need more than 3 variations"
- Ask explicitly: "Create 5 variations"
- Try different mode combinations
- Use tone modifiers for additional variations

### "Framework selection seems off"
- Specify framework directly: "Use SVC framework"
- Or request: "Write naturally without framework"
- Remember: Simple edits don't need frameworks!
