### 10.3 When Full Mode Isn't Needed
**Original:** "what's the capital of France?"

This simple factual query doesn't benefit from Full Mode optimization. The prompt is already clear and specific. Full Mode would over-engineer it into something like:

"As a geography expert, identify the capital city of France, including its administrative status, population, and significance as the seat of government..."

**Lesson:** Use Full Mode for complex, multi-faceted prompts where clarity and completeness matter. Simple queries are fine as-is.

---

**Remember:** Not every prompt needs every enhancement. Match complexity to task needs. Full Mode is powerful but not always necessary.
