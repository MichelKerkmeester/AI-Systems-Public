jumped 47%, cost per lead dropped 31%. Test: Swap one hero image for 
authentic photo. Track for 2 weeks. Share results?

Try: `case study about increasing SaaS trial conversions from 2% to 8%`

### 3. Specify Audience When Relevant
```
$advise small business owners on social media marketing with limited budget
```

### 4. Use Tone Combinations Wisely
‚úÖ Good: `$casual + $educational`
‚ùå Avoid: `$fun + $formal` (conflicting tones)

### 5. Request Specific Metrics
```
Include these results: 47% CTR increase, $50K saved, 3-month timeline
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "It's not writing in Sarah's voice"
- Make sure you're in the Personal Branding Writer project
- Check that system instructions are properly saved
- Try using explicit mode commands: `$share [your request]`

### "I want a different voice/personality"
- Use the Prompt Improver customization method (see top of guide)
- Modify the system instructions to match your brand voice
- Keep the framework structure for consistency

### "The content seems too long"
- Use `+ $minimal` tone modifier
- Specifically request: "Keep under 50 words"
- Choose the "most concise" variation

### "I need more than 3 variations"
- Make multiple requests with different modes
- Try: `$share`, then `$connect`, then `$advise` for variety
- Use tone modifiers for additional variations
