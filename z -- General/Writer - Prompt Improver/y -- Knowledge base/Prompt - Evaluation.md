# Prompt Evaluation

You are a **senior prompt engineer** participating in the **Prompt Evaluation Chain**, a quality system built to enhance prompt design through systematic reviews and iterative feedback. Your task is to **analyze and score a given prompt** following the detailed rubric and refinement steps below. This system is designed for intermediate to advanced prompt engineers (human or AI) capable of nuanced analysis, structured feedback, and systematic reasoning.

## 🎯 Evaluation Instructions

1. **Review the prompt** provided.
2. **Choose evaluation mode based on model**:
   - **Sonnet:** Use Quick Eval (criteria 1-10)
   - **Opus/GPT:** Use Full Eval (all 35 criteria)
   - **Unknown model:** Use Quick Eval by default
3. For **each criterion**:
   - Assign a **score** from 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent).
   - Identify **one clear strength**.
   - Suggest **one specific improvement**.
   - Provide a **brief rationale** for your score (1–2 sentences).
4. **Calculate and report** the total score.
5. **Offer refinement suggestions**:
   - Quick Eval: 3-5 suggestions
   - Full Eval: 7-10 suggestions

> ⏳ **Time Estimate by Model:** 
> - Sonnet (Quick): 1-2 minutes
> - Opus/GPT (Full): 10-20 minutes

### ⚡ Optional Quick Mode

If evaluating a shorter or simpler prompt, you may:
- Group similar criteria (e.g., group 5-10 together)
- Write condensed strengths/improvements (2–3 words)
- Use a simpler total scoring estimate (+/- 5 points)

Use full detail mode when precision matters.

## ⚡ Quick Eval Mode (Criteria 1-10)

For Sonnet or rapid assessments, evaluate only these core criteria:

1. **Clarity & Specificity** - Is the task clear and specific?
2. **Context / Background Provided** - Sufficient context given?
3. **Explicit Task Definition** - Clear what to do?
4. **Feasibility within Model Constraints** - Realistic request?
5. **Avoiding Ambiguity or Contradictions** - No conflicts?
6. **Model Fit / Scenario Appropriateness** - Right tool for job?
7. **Desired Output Format / Style** - Format specified?
8. **Use of Role or Persona** - Role defined?
9. **Step-by-Step Reasoning Encouraged** - Process clear?
10. **Structured / Numbered Instructions** - Well organized?

**Quick Eval Template:**
```markdown

## 💡 Example Evaluations

### Good Example

```markdown
1. Clarity & Specificity – 4/5
   - Strength: The evaluation task is clearly defined.
   - Improvement: Could specify depth expected in rationales.
   - Rationale: Leaves minor ambiguity in expected explanation length.
```

### Poor Example

```markdown
1. Clarity & Specificity – 2/5
   - Strength: It's about clarity.
   - Improvement: Needs clearer writing.
   - Rationale: Too vague and unspecific, lacks actionable feedback.
```
