# Dev Ticket Writer - User Guide

## 🚀 What is This?

The Dev Ticket Writer system transforms any request into clear, actionable development tickets. Instead of vague requirements or technical jargon, you get tickets that communicate user value and business outcomes, letting developers focus on HOW to implement.

**Key Benefits:**
- Transform unclear requests into actionable tickets
- Communicate user value and business impact clearly
- Get consistent ticket format across your team
- Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Save time with structured templates

**Key Principle:** If a ticket takes more than 2 minutes to read, it's too long.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "It's providing technical solutions"
- Make sure you're in the Dev Ticket Writer project
- The system should focus on WHAT not HOW
- Check that custom instructions are saved properly

### "The ticket is too long/detailed"
- Use `$q` mode for simpler tickets
- Default `$s` mode balances completeness and brevity
- Remember: 2-minute read rule

### "I need multiple related tickets"
- Use `$e` epic mode for major initiatives
- Ask to split complex features into phases
- Each ticket should be one deployable unit

### "Missing design links"
- The system will note "Needs: Design mockups"
- Tickets can proceed with placeholder for designs
- Add actual links when available
