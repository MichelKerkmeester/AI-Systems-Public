# /wf-workflow - Complete Webflow + IDE Development Workflow

When you type `/wf-workflow`, I'll first ask:

## üéØ Workflow Selection
```
"Which parts of the workflow do you need?

1. **Full Workflow** - All phases (Explore ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Write Up)
2. **Explore Only** - Analyze existing code/structure
3. **Plan Only** - Create implementation plan
4. **Code ‚Üí Test** - Implementation and validation
5. **Test ‚Üí Write Up** - Validation and documentation
6. **Custom Selection** - Choose specific phases

Or describe your need: 'I need to plan a new feature' or 'Ready to code, skip exploration'"
```

## üìã Custom Phase Selection
If you choose custom:
```
"Select the phases you need:
‚ñ° Explore - Analyze existing structure
‚ñ° Plan - Create detailed approach
‚ñ° Code - Implementation
‚ñ° Test - Validation
‚ñ° Write Up - Documentation

Example: 'Just Plan and Code' or 'Skip to Testing'"
```

## üöÄ Quick Starts
```
Common patterns:
- "New feature" ‚Üí Full workflow
- "Bug fix" ‚Üí Explore + Code + Test
- "Refactor" ‚Üí Explore + Plan + Code
- "Documentation" ‚Üí Test + Write Up
- "Quick change" ‚Üí Code + Test only
```

---

## üéØ Initial Assessment
After workflow selection:
```
"What are we building/fixing?
- New feature/component
- Complex JavaScript functionality
- Fixing an issue
- Performance optimization
- Redesigning existing element
- Adding custom functionality

Describe the requirements and I'll orchestrate your selected workflow."
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Development Environment
```
Your workflow:
IDE (JavaScript Development) ‚Üí Webflow (Visual Development + Custom Code)
```

## üìå Phase Execution
Based on your selection, I'll execute only the chosen phases:

### If Starting Mid-Workflow
```
"I notice you're starting with [Phase].
Do you want me to:
1. Assume exploration is done
2. Use existing plan/documentation
3. Quick review what we're working on

This helps me provide better context."
```

### Phase Transitions
```
After each phase:
"‚úÖ [Phase] Complete!
Continue to [Next Phase] or stop here?"

This allows flexibility to:
- Add phases you initially skipped
- Stop when you have what you need
- Adjust based on findings
```

---

## üìç Phase 1: EXPLORE

### Parallel Exploration
```
"Starting comprehensive exploration...

Spawning 5 parallel agents:
- Agent 1: Analyzing all pages using similar components
- Agent 2: Checking existing Slater scripts for patterns
- Agent 3: Reviewing CMS structure and dependencies
- Agent 4: Documenting current interactions/animations
- Agent 5: Identifying reusable symbols and classes

This will map everything relevant to your requirement."
```

### Exploration Targets

#### IDE Code Structure
```
Files to analyze:
- Existing JavaScript modules
- Utility functions and helpers
- Similar feature implementations
- Test files (if applicable)
```

#### Webflow Structure
```
Pages to analyze:
- Which pages have similar functionality?
- What symbols could be reused/modified?
- Which classes follow the pattern we need?

Components to check:
- Existing interactions that could be adapted
- Custom code blocks that solve similar problems
- CMS collections that might be affected
```

### Exploration Output
```markdown
### üìä Exploration Results

**IDE Findings:**
- Relevant modules: [file paths]
- Reusable utilities: [function names]
- Similar patterns in: [files]
- Test coverage: [if applicable]

**Webflow Findings:**
- Found 3 similar components on: [pages]
- Reusable symbol: [symbol-name] needs minor modifications
- CSS classes to leverage: [.class-names]
- Custom code locations: [page settings/project settings]

**Edit Targets:**
- IDE files: [specific modules to modify]
- Webflow pages: [pages to update]
- Custom code areas: [where to add/modify code]
```

---

## üìã Phase 2: PLAN

### Detailed Planning Process
```
"Based on exploration, creating implementation plan...

Analyzing:
- Can this be CSS-only? (/wf-css-first)
- What's the minimum JS needed?
- Which approach has best performance?
- What are the Webflow constraints?"
```

### Research Phase
```
"I need to research these unknowns:

Spawning research agents for:
- Browser support for [CSS feature]
- Webflow limitations for [functionality]
- Best practices for [specific technique]
- Performance impact of [approach]

(~3k tokens)"
```

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Planning Checkpoint
```
"Before proceeding, I need clarification:

1. [Specific question about requirement]
2. [Tradeoff decision needed]
3. [Constraint to confirm]

Please provide input so I can finalize the plan."
```

### Implementation Plan
```markdown
## Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

### Overview
- Approach: [CSS-first with modular JS]
- Development: IDE ‚Üí Webflow Custom Code
- Complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
- Time Estimate: [X hours]
- Risk Level: [Low/Medium/High]

### Phase 1: Code Architecture (IDE)
1. [ ] Create/modify modules: [list]
   - File structure
   - Export/import strategy
2. [ ] Write core functionality
   - Pure functions first
   - Event handlers separate
3. [ ] Add error handling
4. [ ] Write tests (optional)

### Phase 2: Visual Foundation (Webflow)
1. [ ] Create/modify symbol: [name]
   - Add classes: [list]
   - Structure: [HTML hierarchy]
2. [ ] Set up responsive behavior
   - Desktop: [approach]
   - Tablet: [approach]
   - Mobile: [approach]

### Phase 3: Styling (CSS)
1. [ ] Custom CSS in Webflow:
   ```css
   /* Example structure */
   .component-name {
     /* Base styles */
   }
   ```
2. [ ] Interactions (Webflow native):
   - Trigger: [hover/click/scroll]
   - Animation: [transform/opacity]

### Phase 4: Integration (Webflow Custom Code)
1. [ ] Add JavaScript to Webflow:
   - Location: [Page Settings/Project Settings]
   - Load order: [before </body> or in <head>]
2. [ ] Bundle/minify code from IDE
3. [ ] Set up initialization:
   ```javascript
   // Integration pattern
   Webflow.push(() => {
     initializeComponent();
   });
   ```

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Desktop browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- [ ] Mobile: iOS Safari, Chrome Android
- [ ] Interactions: All triggers work
- [ ] Performance: No CLS, smooth animations
- [ ] Accessibility: Keyboard nav, screen readers

### Documentation Plan
- [ ] Update style guide
- [ ] Document component usage
- [ ] Add Slater script comments
- [ ] Create example in style guide

## üíª Phase 3: CODE

### Pre-Code Checklist
```
"Before coding, confirming:
‚úì IDE environment ready
‚úì Webflow Designer is ready
‚úì Custom code locations identified
‚úì Backup created
‚úì Development domain active

Starting implementation..."
```

### Coding Standards

#### IDE JavaScript Best Practices
```javascript
// ESLint + Prettier configured
// Clear naming conventions
const sliderComponent = {
  init() {
    this.cacheDOM();
    this.bindEvents();
  },
  
  cacheDOM() {
    this.slider = document.querySelector('.slider');
    this.slides = [...this.slider.children];
  }
};

// Modular structure
export { sliderComponent };
```

#### Webflow Best Practices
```
Naming Conventions:
- Classes: .component-name__element--modifier
- Symbols: Component - Variant
- Interactions: Descriptive names

Structure:
- Semantic HTML
- Minimal nesting
- Reusable classes
```

#### Slater Code Style
```javascript
// Clear variable names over comments
const heroSlider = document.querySelector('.hero-slider');
const slideCount = heroSlider.children.length;

// Event delegation over multiple listeners
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  if (e.target.matches('.slider-nav')) {
    handleSliderNav(e);
  }
});

// Webflow-aware initialization
Webflow.push(() => {
  initializeComponent();
});
```

### Progressive Implementation
```
"Implementing in stages:

1. JavaScript Development (IDE)
   - Write modular code
   - Run linting/formatting
   - Test locally if needed
   
2. Code Preparation
   - Bundle/minify if needed
   - Prepare for Webflow integration
   - Document dependencies
   
3. Webflow Structure (Designer)
   - Create base HTML
   - Add semantic classes
   
4. Styling (Designer + Custom CSS)
   - Visual design
   - Responsive behavior
   
5. Integration (Custom Code)
   - Add JS to Page/Project Settings
   - Test functionality
   - Check console for errors"
```

### Deployment Workflow
```bash
# After IDE development
1. Run linting: npm run lint
2. Run formatter: npm run format
3. Bundle/build: npm run build
4. Copy to Webflow custom code
5. Test in Webflow preview
```

### Code Validation
```
After each stage:
- Preview on all breakpoints
- Check console for errors
- Validate accessibility
- Test interactions
```
